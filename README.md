# TASK DESCRIPTION

A REST API Client is a tool or program that interacts with RESTful web services using the standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for designing networked applications, especially web services, due to its simplicity, statelessness, and scalability.

A REST API client sends HTTP requests to RESTful servers (often known as REST APIs) and receives responses—usually in formats like JSON or XML. The primary goal of a REST API client is to consume the functionalities exposed by a REST API, such as retrieving user data, submitting forms, updating resources, or deleting entries.

Key Functionalities of a REST API Client
Request Formation
The client builds an HTTP request with the appropriate URL endpoint, headers (like Content-Type and Authorization), and, in case of POST or PUT, a request body (usually JSON or XML).

Sending Requests
The client sends the request to the API endpoint using HTTP methods:

GET for retrieving data

POST for creating data

PUT or PATCH for updating data

DELETE for removing data

Handling Responses
The server responds with status codes (like 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and data. The client must parse this response to display results or take appropriate action.

Authentication
Many REST APIs require authentication through API keys, bearer tokens, or OAuth. The client handles this by setting the proper headers before sending a request.

Examples of REST API Clients
Postman: A graphical tool to test and automate REST API calls.

cURL: A command-line tool used to make HTTP requests.

Java REST Clients: Java applications use libraries like HttpURLConnection, Apache HttpClient, or Retrofit to act as REST clients.

Python REST Clients: Use libraries like requests.

Use Cases
Integrating third-party services like payment gateways (Razorpay, PayPal)

Consuming APIs for weather, location, news, etc.

Backend communication in microservices

Mobile or web apps fetching or sending data to a remote server
